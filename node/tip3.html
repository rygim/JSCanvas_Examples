<span id="fps" class="hidden">
<h4>Frames per second</h4>
Frames per second is a good way to judge the responsiveness of your app
Make sure to stress your application to see where the minimum number of frames per second are in the application
</span>

<span id="memory" class="hidden">
<h4>Memory</h4>
Javascript has it's own garbage collector
two guidelines from the apple developer site:
use the delete keyword to free unused memory
use the var keyword
Be wary of closures as they may contain hidden memory leaks
